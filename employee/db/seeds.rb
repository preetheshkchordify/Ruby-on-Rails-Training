# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# e1 = Employe.create(name: 'Saji', age: 22, email: "saji@gmail.com", location: "Trivandrum", dept: "Developer")
# e2 = Employe.create(name: 'Sajan', age: 24, email: "sajan@gmail.com", location: "Kochi", dept: "Tester")
# e3 = Employe.create(name: 'Raj', age: 25, email: "Raj@gmail.com", location: "Kochi", dept: "Tester")
# e4 = Employe.create(name: 'Joy', age: 27, email: "Joy@gmail.com", location: "Trivandrum", dept: "Developer")
